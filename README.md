# Final Project

This is the final project of Kiara Martin for the Peckham Digital Accelerator Zone: Introduction to Data Science course. 

I will be cleaning and comparing annual sunshine and rainfall data in England from 2015 to 2024 (Met Office, 2025) against annual Chlamydia diagnoses in people aged 15 to 24 years in England between 2015 to 2024 data (GOV.UK, 2025) in attempts to identify a possible correlation between the two datasets.


## Acknowledgements

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the team at Peckham DAZ and to my mentor, Yifan Feng, for their invaluable guidance and support throughout the duration of this course.
